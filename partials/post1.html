	                <h2 id="Top">Post 1: Introduction</h2>
	                <p><span class="firstwords">I grew</span> up with Times New Roman 12pt.</p>
	                <p>That is to say that my first notice of typography was upon installing Microsoft Office 2007. Expecting to write my essays as normal—and hopefully with an improved user interface and additional features—I was horrified to find that my flagship font had been replaced with 11pt Calibri as the Word default.</p> 
	                <p>Calibri represents more than anything a shift in public reading practices. As the screen begins to rival print as a primary medium, software manufacturers are reprioritizing typographic development. <a href="#Boardley">Boardley</a> (2008) cites Times New Roman as a font particularly ill-suited for online body text because it is naturally quite narrow set. Calibri, on the other hand, is Microsoft's attempt not only to optimize on-screen reading for users but to use the new font as leverage over Apple, their primary rival (<a href="#Wagener">Van Wagener</a>, 2005). Calibri and other newly developed Microsoft fonts are not readable to MAC users, unless licensed by individuals (<a href="#Wagener">Van Wagener</a>, 2005). Software wars are now being waged at the level of basic legibility.</p>
	                <h2 id="Ideal">Ideal Type</h2>
	                <p><span class="firstwords">Interestingly</span>, if the primary purpose of typography is readability (<a href="#Wagener">Van Wagener</a>, 2005; <a href="#Reich">Reichenstein</a>, 2006), then the best type may ultimately be the least noticeable to viewers. <a href="#Coupland">Coupland</a> (2006), in his ode to Helvetica notes that Helvetica is the Latin word for "Swiss" and that the type itself was designed to be "emotionally neutral" (para. 5). Coupland's only irritation with Helvetica is its common misuse in historical settings that predate the type's development; therefore, Helvetica is most inaffective when noticed at all. While complete agreement on typographic best practices is unlikely, if not impossible, it has been shown that the average user will only stay focused on the screen for five minutes (<a href="#Reich">Reichenstein</a>, 2006), and any time spent focused on typographical distractions will pull focus from the page's contents.</p>
	                <p>Though the rapid growth of on-screen reading has inspired recent font development, <a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a> (2005) claims that, overall, typography has suffered at the hand of technology. Of course, designing a readable font is only a small part of the typographic discipline; the earliest typographers had only one font at their disposal and managed to produce some of history's most aesthetically pleasing manuscripts (<a href="#Reich">Reichenstein</a>, 2006). In fact, <a href="#Boardley">Boardley</a> (2008) claims that it is inherently easier to choose a font when writing for the web because there are fewer of them. However, it is a valid claim that with the advent of computer technology, designers have become disconnected from the letterforms and the setting of them (<a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a>, 2005).</p>
	                <p>Early manuscripts illuminated and highlighted the type, drawing the reader's eye. Though these efforts have largely vanished from modern print culture, traces of illumination remain in the form of serif fonts, such as my beloved Times New Roman. Online reading, on the other hand, spurs the opposite tactics; serifs are often removed, and as previously mentioned, the best type may be that which goes unnoticed. However, as an invisible force of web design, ideal typography should provide three ascending layers of service: legibility, organization and direction. If these three pillars are achieved correctly, typography can make the leap from design into art.</p>
	                <h2 id="Legibility">Legibility</h2>
	                <p><span class="firstwords">If the</span> purpose of web writing is the sharing of information, then it is hard to argue that legibility is the foundation of good typography. Beyond simply choosing a basic readable font—such as the notably spare, Calibri, Ariel, or Helvetica—there are many factors that contribute to basic legibility. These include:
	                </p><ul>
	                    <li><a href="#Measure">Measure</a></li>
	                    <li><a href="#Spacing">Spacing</a></li>
	                    <li><a href="#Leading">Leading</a></li>
	                    <li><a href="#Weight">Weight</a></li>
	                </ul><p></p>
	                <h3 id="Measure">Measure</h3>
	                <p><a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a> (2005) argues that the optimum measure for body text is 2-3 alphabets (52-78 characters) in length, including spaces. At the core of this recommendation is flow: the measure is designed so the eye can move efficiently along the page and from one line to the next. Too short and the eye will be constantly moving, while if too long, readers will have trouble transitioning from one line into the next.</p>
	                <h3 id="Spacing">Spacing</h3>
	                <p>Even if a measure is correct, improper spacing may be a distraction if letters are packed so close as to render a word illegible or so far as to disrupt its unity. To that end, spacing between words must obviously be greater than spaces between letters, and the two should be adjusted proportionally (<a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a>, 2005). Within any single word, letters should be kerned so that the spacing between them remains constant (<a href="#Lupton">Lupton</a>, 2009). To this end, <a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a> (2005) cites the use of ligatures (Fig. 1) as a mark of typographical maturity. Devised in the sixteenth century, ligatures deal with spacing issues between common combinations of letters by showcasing these combinations in their most readable form.</p> 
	                <div class="image"><a href="#Boulton"><img src="ligature.gif" alt="Common Latin Ligatures"></a></div>
	                <h3 id="Leading">Leading</h3>
	                <p>Working in conjunction with both measure and spacing, leading must be designed so that the reader's eyes move along a line of text, rather than down to the next one. Though <a href="#Lupton">Lupton</a> (2009) notes that Roman letters were designed to sit side by side rather than atop one another, proper leading can aid this end. <a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a> (2005) asserts that ideal leading should increase in proportion with the measure and be wider than spacing.</p>
	                <h3 id="Weight">Weight</h3>
	                <p>While standard font weight is usually adequate for black type on a white background, a change in color or emphasis can affect the ideal weight. White on black text, for example, is a higher contrast than the reverse and so requires a decrease in font weight (<a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a>, 2005). Text bolded for emphasis should be weighted so as to stand distinctly in contrast to the main paragraph text.</p>
	                <h2 id="Organization">Organization</h2>
	                <p><span class="firstwords">Already</span>, proper legibility should be provide a launching ground for overall textual organization. Font size and weight provide structure and hierarchy by distinguishing certain words or lines from the text. <a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a> (2005) notes that the important principle when structuring headings that are not adequately differentiated from body content may be passed by, without readers understanding their import; however, on the other hand, headings that are too large or bold compared to the main text will ultimately cause a jarring disruption in reading.</p>
	                <p>Another organizational factor advocated strongly by <a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a> (2005) is the hanging bullet, as well as hanging quotes. He argues that the human eye is attracted to straight lines and that indentation of lists and quotes destroys the flow of the text. Since hanging quotes and bullets reside outside the usual margins, lists and block quotes need not be further indented. <a href="#Rutter">Rutter</a> (2005) supports retaining straight lines, citing Robert Bringhurst's assertion that the indent is only used to set a new paragraph apart from what precedes it; since HTML by default generates a space between paragraphs, online writing mainly starts flush with the left margin, while most printed work still chooses to retain indentation.</p> 
	                <h2 id="Direction">Direction</h2>
	                <p><span class="firstwords">The final</span> layer of ideal typography is the smooth guidance of the reader through the text. <a href="#Lupton">Lupton</a> (2009), in Thinking with Type argues that expressing the meaning of each word is the final and fullest goal of typography. <a href="#Boardley">Boardley</a>(2008) advocates the similar aim of aiding rather than hindering the reading pleasure. To this end, the headings and enlarged capitals that Boulton championed on grounds of structure and hierarchy are seen as invitations to enter the text, while small caps ease the transition between these large capitals and regular text (Lupton, 2009).</p> 
	                <p>On a large scale, typography is essentially information design (<a href="#Reich">Reichenstein</a>, 2006), and its proper execution creates an "elegant economy of signals" (Lupton, 2009) to the reader. Ruder (as cited in <a href="#Reich">Reichenstein</a>, 2006), long before online typography entered the scene, said that,
	                </p><blockquote>It is the typographer's task to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him. (para. 3) </blockquote>
	                A good typographer will not only highlight what is of interest to the reader but also present it in its proper context through well-structured type.<p></p>
	                <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	                <p><span class="firstwords">It is </span>only upon achieving all three of these phases that typography can assert the full extent of its artistic and aesthetic influences over the text. Speaking particularly of Helvetica, <a href="#Coupland">Coupland</a> (2006) asserts that it can modernize words and phrases merely through its neutrality and sparcity. </p>
	                <p>While <a href="#Reich">Reichenstein</a>'s (2006) claim that "web design is 95% typography" is perhaps a slight exaggeration, he does rightly point out that typography is the primary method of information sharing on the web. The new typographic developments in pursuit of greater readability only underscores the fundamental importance of font and bulwarks <a href="#Boulton">Boulton</a>'s (2005) claim that legibility is at the core of artistry.</p>
